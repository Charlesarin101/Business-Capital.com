# Business Capital

## Human Capital From Scratch

Business Capital is a workforce foundry.

We take willing individuals, form them with discipline and skill, and deploy them to businesses with structured oversight.

We do not recruit.
We form.

---

# 1. Mission

We build human capital from scratch so businesses can succeed.

---

# 2. Definition of “From Scratch”

* No experience required
* No degree necessary
* No connections needed
* Raw potential → formed workforce

If a person is willing, they are trainable.
If they are trainable, they are deployable.

---

# 3. What Business Capital Is

Business Capital is:

* A formation system
* A discipline structure
* A workforce stabilizer
* A reliability engine

Business Capital is not:

* A recruitment agency
* A CV marketplace
* A job listing platform
* A salary commission business

We manufacture job readiness.

# 4. The Three Pillars

## 4.1 Talent Formation

We train raw recruits in discipline, skill, and work ethic before they ever touch a job.

## 4.2 Workforce Placement

We connect formed talent to businesses that need reliable human capital.

## 4.3 Capacity Building

We strengthen existing teams through structured development programs.

# 5. How It Works (Operational Flow)

### Step 1 — Entry

Individual walks in with willingness.

### Step 2 — Screening

Basic literacy check, attitude check, punctuality test.

### Step 3 — Formation (30–90 Days)

* Work readiness training
* Discipline routines
* Skill track development
* Weekly scorecard evaluation

### Step 4 — Matching

We match based on:

* Skill
* Reliability score
* Temperament
* Business need

### Step 5 — Placement

Worker begins employment.

### Step 6 — Oversight (90 Days)

* Weekly check-ins (first month)
* Bi-weekly thereafter
* Performance documentation
* Intervention when necessary

# 6. Training Structure (30-Day Pilot Model)

## Week 1–2: Discipline & Work Readiness

* Punctuality
* Communication
* Accountability
* Workplace conduct
* Reporting discipline
* Hygiene and presentation

Weekly Evaluation:

* Punctuality score (0–5)
* Attitude score (0–5)
* Reporting quality score (0–5)

---

## Week 3–4: Skill Development

Choose one pilot track:

* Cleaning Operations
* Customer Service
* Office Assistant
* Teaching Assistant
* Maintenance Support
* Security Support

Weekly Evaluation:

* Task quality score (0–5)
* Attitude score (0–5)
* Punctuality score (0–5)

---

## Deployment Standard

A trainee is deployable only if:

* Attendance ≥ 90%
* Punctuality average ≥ 4/5
* Attitude ≥ 4/5
* Skill quality ≥ 3.5/5

Anyone below standard enters remediation.

---

# 7. Scorecard System

## Daily Tracking

For each trainee record:

* Arrival time
* Attendance (Yes/No)
* Punctuality score (0–5)
* Attitude score (0–5)
* Task quality score (0–5)
* Reporting quality score (0–5)
* Trainer notes
* Readiness status

Discipline is measured daily.
Skill is measured weekly.

---

## 90-Day Oversight Log

For each deployed worker record:

* Employer name
* Role
* Start date
* Weekly check-in number
* Lateness incidents
* Quality concerns
* Conflict incidents
* Support required
* Oversight action taken
* Status (Active / At Risk / Replacement)

Oversight protects both worker and employer.

---

# 8. Business Model

Businesses do not pay placement fees.

Businesses pay for:

* Formation
* Reliability
* Oversight

Possible structures:

* Formation fee per hire
* Monthly workforce retainer
* Capacity building package

The payment is for system stability, not introduction.

---

# 9. Pilot Location

Phase 1: Zaria, Nigeria

Initial employer base:

* HomExecutives
* Christian Child Academy
* Local SMEs

---

# 10. Success Metrics

Measure weekly:

* Intake → Completion rate
* Placement stability (30 / 60 / 90 days)
* Employer satisfaction (1–5)
* Incident rate
* Time-to-fill

The goal of the pilot is structure validation, not scale.

Form 10.
Deploy 5.
Stabilize 3.
Then expand.

---

# 11. Brand Positioning

Always say:

* Workforce foundry
* Formation before placement
* Human capital from scratch
* 90-day oversight

Never say:

* Recruitment agency
* Job placement company
* HR consultant
* Empowerment program

---

# 12. Operating Principles

* Discipline before skill
* Formation before deployment
* Oversight after placement
* Reliability is engineered
* Without formed people, nothing stands

---

# 13. Founder's Standard

Business Capital is part of a larger stewardship ecosystem.

It exists to provide:

* Stable workers
* Reliable teams
* Structured growth
* Human infrastructure for every future venture

This is not charity.
This is not hype.

This is formation.

---

# 14. Phase 1 Objective

The objective of Phase 1 is proof of structure.

Not growth.
Not publicity.
Not scale.

Proof.

If the system works at 10 people, it can scale to 100.
